1.	Extend the simple class that you did on the previous exercise so it contains the following actions / methods:
-	openDoor, sets the status of the door to open. It must take a numeric argument 1 - 5 (1 = front left, 2 = front right, 3 = back left, 4 = back right, 5 = trunk)
-	closeDoor, sets the status of the door to open. It must take a numeric argument 1-5 (1 = front left, 2 = front right, 3 = back left, 4 = back right, 5 = trunk)
- openCloseDoor, sets the status of the door to the reversive status
-	inspectDoors, takes an argument of status open or close and prints a list of the doors with their corresponding status 
In order to implement this feature you will need to create an array for the initialized number of doors and assign a status to each door.

2. Implement the previous question with any design pattern you think is the most appropriate for the job
